copy of this product page in amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Doug-Stuffed-Washable-Surface/dp/B004N7NFSK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=AFXGJZ1AOOVT&keywords=melissa+and+doug+bunny&qid=1649507567&s=toys-and-games-intl-ship&sprefix=melissa+and+doug+b%2Ctoys-and-games-intl-ship%2C293&sr=1-1

pay attention- the page might change or the same product might be replaced with other, depend on Amazon company.

I built this page using css+html. I made different css file for general\navbar\main for each mobile and desktop. I used flex property for all the containers.

responsive layout: I defined the mobile and desktop html layout differntly, made the same section twice with changes. I used deiffernet media query css files for this with some classes being display: none to achieve my goal.

I made some global varaibles and also some general classes which used me in different html locations (same color\font size that return itself a lot, for example).
